The user avatar Wander in the work is an AI robot wandering around on the future earth. The audience can add WeChat ID: ‘wanderingbot’ to become a participant in the user experience. Participants can send actual locations to Wander via WeChat. Wander will start traveling from a random ‘future time’ and send back the coordinate marks, sci-fi travel notes and virtual street scene pictures. All these graphic information has been generated based on real location information. Wander can also explore freely on the map location of the ‘future time’, such as talking with the robot dog around him, witnessing the aircraft invading overhead, exploring the ruins and so on. The time when Wander travels is uncertain, and the results of his trips will be recorded on the map website in real time. With the participation of the audience, the future map will be continuously improved to form into a science fiction world that is jointly constructed by humans and AI. The artist will make further creations based on the travel notes and images sent by Wander, and then extend his vision for the future through man-machine cooperation.",

                "作品简介：\n林万山的《十方》是通过脑补传感器生成的互动影像。在一个无限“十方”装置之中，没有时间。时间只是意识的错觉，意识缔造了东南西北，生死未来。当意识成为时间，十大方向之中，上天、下地、东、西、南、北、生门、死位、过去、未来，便成为一个可被缔结的空间，而当空间失去意义，意识便在瞬间成为永恒。所谓十方，在定义中其实是无限，意识才是主角。作品《十方》分两个部分，第一部分是通过行为手段的演绎，将一个思绪冥想者的思维变化呈现到装置之中，行为者通过自身肢体动作和光影的变化，呈现起，通，达，静这四个阶段的思维历程。第二部分，观者佩戴脑机的进入，去试图模仿禅定的状态，从而实现影像的平衡状态。读取现场观众的注意力和冥想数值，通过数字可视化，将即时影像传输到装置之中，影像自身呈现无尽的思维状态，各个面之间的关系是无限反射，但是观者仍然能够在外部看到内部的无限空间，只要进入了这个“无限空间”，这里的一切就已经超越了生死，无关时间。会根据当前佩戴者的思维起伏产生相应的变化，体验着要试着模仿僧人入定的状态，即冥想，将注意力和冥想值达到某一个平衡状态，从而使影像发生静止与消失。到达现场的每一位观众都可以走进这个无限空间，戴上脑部传感器，观察自己的大脑和思维之间的微妙联系。\nDescription:\nLin Wanshan's Shi Fang is an interactive image generated by brain supplement sensors. In an infinite ‘ten directions’ installation, there is no time. Time is just an illusion of consciousness, which creates the future of life and death. When consciousness becomes time, among the ten directions, heaven, earth, east, west, south, north, life gate, death position, past, and future, it becomes a space that can be concluded. When space loses its meaning, consciousness becomes eternal in an instant. The so-called ten directions are infinite in the definition, and consciousness is the protagonist. The work Shi Fang is divided into two parts. The first part is the interpretation of behavioral means, which presents the thinking changes of a thought meditator into the installation. With his body languages and the light changes, the behaving one is presenting his quiet thinking process of four stages: rising, passing, arriving, and calming. In the second part, the viewer wears a brain sensor to try to imitate the state of meditation, so that to achieve a balanced state of the image. By reading the audience’s attention and meditation values and transmitting real-time images to the device through digital visualization, the image itself presents an endless state of thinking, and the relationship between the various aspects is infinite reflection to each other. However, the viewer can still see the interior from the outside. As long as you enter this ‘infinite space’, everything here has transcended life and death, and has nothing to do with time. It will produce corresponding changes according to the current wearer's thinking fluctuations. The experience is to try to imitate the state of the monk entering the concentration, that is, meditation, to achieve a certain balance of attention and meditation value, so that the image will become static and disappear. Every audience who arrives at the scene can walk into this infinite space, wear a brain sensor, and observe the subtle connection between their brain and thinking.",
